Feetsolutions is a custom orthotics manufacturing laboratory based in Barcelona, working with various podiatry clinics across Spain. The mission of this project has been to take the customized application they had for their clients and develop new functionalities requested by the client, aiming to improve their product both on the frontend and backend levels.

Additionally, we have been involved in the professionalization of the infrastructure, migrating from a generic hosting service to Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing various services to optimize the performance and scalability of the application.

## Tech Stack

As mentioned previously, this tech stack was chosen by the previous developers who started the application.

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php): The entire backend is developed in PHP, using a custom framework. Although this is not the best practice, so far the client has not requested any changes in this area.
- [React](https://react.dev/): A library that enables the reactivity of the application
