The Munoa Project is an application developed for the Munoa Palace, located in Barakaldo, Bizkaia. This application is installed on a totem placed on one side of the palace. Through an intuitive menu, users can explore the history of the municipality. The information available in the application is the same as that found on the visitbarakaldo.eus website, created by the City Council using proprietary and pioneering technology, ensuring that all devices and platforms access up-to-date information in real time.

## Technology stack

The tool has been built using the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/): A library that enables the reactivity of the application, enhancing the user experience. Since this is a moderately complex application, React was chosen for its simplicity and suitability based on our prior experience.

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): A framework built on top of React that facilitates the creation of static web applications. Its ability to optimize performance and ease of deployment for static sites were key factors in its selection. **Now will be more interesting implement it with Astro js.**

- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/): A headless CMS chosen for its ease of content management in a simple and intuitive way, both for the development team and the client. Strapi provides an API that allows easy connection to the site, simplifying content integration and updates.
